# TadQuest

1st place entry for the 2024 New Mexico Technology Student Association (NMTSA) Middle School Video Game Design competition.

## How to Play

Control the frog by pressing and holding down the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) or W, A, S, and D keys (W → up, A → left, S → down, D → right). While the frog is outside the water, pressing the up direction will make the frog jump. While the frog is in water, he can move faster in every direction. Traverse the level using the controls to reach the colorful tadpole at the end of each level. Finding and touching the tadpole completes the level, taking you to the next.
